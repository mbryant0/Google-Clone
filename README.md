# Google-Clone

September 10, 2020
This is my very first coding project! I made a clone of the Google homepage using only HTML and CSS. 
There are still some improvements to be made:

1) I still need to add responsive design so that mobile devices will display the page properly.
2) I would like to edit the code so that the search bar animates when the user first launches it.
3) Some of the buttons still need additional hover states.
4) And more...

However, I am content with my progress so far, and will come back to this project periodically to update it as my skillset improves.
